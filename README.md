This repository has three branches, the first one being main and the second one being front-end and last being back-end. 
Front-end
Back-end
This is the application for servers. you can add the server and ping the server you want to ping. it is not hosted on any platform. to test it you will need to clone the project and connect locally and test it.
When you ping the server it will check that server is it reachable and if it up and running. if it running it will tell the status.
if it running it wil tell you by chenging the color for your status. if it up you will see the up with green text and if it down you will see by red colour stating that the server is down.
Thank you.
